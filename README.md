# Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a portfolio website showcasing my development projects as well as design and mathematics. Unfortunately, my GitHub Page is quite outdated. I hadn’t taken the time to provide proper documentation or version control for my projects, but I plan to do so now. You're more than welcome to use this as a template for your site, just follow appropriate installation instructions here.

## Installation
1. Run these following commands (npm audit fix if it shows some third-party pacakages to download):
>npm install
>
>npm audit fix
>
>npm audit

2. Add your own assets folder under src. Update Home.tsx under src/pages with the new asset tags. I have mine under gitignore so you are able to clone and rework this site with your own work. 

3. Run this command to see localhost:
>npm run dev

Or run this command to build your site:
>npm run build
